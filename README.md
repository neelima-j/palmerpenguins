Visualisations in R with ggplot2

intro-to-ggplot2-with-palmer-penguins.ipynb  
Using ggplot2, I've made various plots to:

- explore the data using histograms, density plots  
- find correlations using scatter plots  
- plot correlations tidily  


diamonds.rmd
Explored the diamonds dataset to:

- explore the data with barplots 
- plot means and underlying data using jitter plots 
- control for variables and look for correlations using facet_grid
